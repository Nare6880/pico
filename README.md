## Description

This project was heavily inspired by [picobot](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/) a website that introduces the basics finite state machines by allowing users to Set up states with rules and actions that define the movement of the picobot inside of a level. The goal of this project is to simplify the barrier to entry of these concepts even further by allowing for the rules to be configured through interaction with a GUI rather than creating the rules utilizing the semi-confusing language that picobot provides.
